Learning how to use GitHub
This is me learning not only how to use GitHub, but also about coding, which is a very scary subject for me.
You have to understand this:  I have 0 knowledge of computer programming, software engineering etc.  I'm just your average computer "user" ... if you know what I mean.
I equate this (i.e. anything related to computer coding) as a form of Extreme Sport of the mind.
